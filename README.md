# Linear Classifiers from Scratch: Rice & Fashion-MNIST

## Project Overview
This project implements fundamental linear classification algorithms from scratch using NumPy and scientific Python libraries. It includes both binary classification (Rice dataset) and multi-class classification (Fashion-MNIST). Final results are evaluated on train/val/test splits and Kaggle submissions.

## Implemented Models
- logistic.py – Logistic Regression (binary)
- perceptron.py – Perceptron Classifier
- svm.py – Support Vector Machine
- softmax.py – Softmax Regression

## Datasets
- **Rice Dataset**: Binary classification dataset with 0/1 labels.  
  ⚠️ *Note: This dataset is not included in the repository*

- **Fashion-MNIST**: Multi-class image dataset (0–9 categories).  
  ⚠️ *Note: Fashion-MNIST files are not included. 

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
2. Download datasets as needed.
3. Open the notebook:
    jupyter notebook Linear_Classifiers_Rice_FashionMNIST.ipynb
